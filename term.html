</p>
				<p>14. Benchmarking Data.

				<p>16. Certificates of Insurance.
Diversified Risk Solutions, LLC. may obtain, review and track certificates of insurance for you.

You must not rely on the information provided by Diversified Risk Solutions, LLC. as an alternative to legal advice from an attorney nor should you delay seeking legal advice, disregard legal advice, or commence or discontinue any legal action.
You should also understand that a certificate of insurance is an informational document that evidences the existence of the policy to which it refers. It does not create any coverage or legal obligations between the insurance company and the certificate holder. Nor does it confer additional insured status to a certificate holder. A certificate of insurance does not alter the terms of the parties' underlying contract or indemnity agreement.
A certificate of insurance typically identifies the agent or broker, the insured, and the insurer providing the coverage. It also gives basic information about the policy to which it refers, including the type of insurance, the policy number, the effective and expiration dates of the policy and the liability limits. However, neither the insurance company nor the broker who issued the certificate of insurance has a duty to inform a certificate holder of inaccuracies in, or subsequent changes to, the information contained in a certificate of insurance. There is also no duty to inform the certificate holder that the policy to which the certificate refers has been cancelled or was not renewed.
To fully understand the potential coverage provided under a policy, a certificate holder should secure a copy of the insurance policy and consult with a qualified attorney.
</p>
				<p>17. Policy Summaries.
The coverage, exclusion, endorsement and other summaries provided by Diversified Risk Solutions, LLC. are for general informational purposes only. They not intended to provide legal advice, and should not be treated as such.
Diversified Risk Solutions, LLC. uses its best efforts to?prepare?the policy summaries, but does not?guarantee their accuracy. ?You should review your actual policy to confirm coverage. The availability of coverage under your specific policy depends on the policy language, the facts of the claim and the law of the jurisdiction governing the interpretation of the policy.
</p>
				<p>18. No Modification of Insurance Policy or Coverage.

You acknowledge that these Terms may evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Francisco County, California for any actions for which Diversified Risk Solutions, LLC. retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of its copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration section below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm.

</p>
				<p>24. Informal Dispute Resolution
For any dispute with Diversified Risk Solutions, LLC., you agree to first contact us at Team@Divrisk.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that we are not able to resolve the dispute after 60 days, we agree that any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Additional Terms shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor, for mediation, and if the matter is not resolved through mediation, then it shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor, for final and binding arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provision below.
Either party may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and the other party a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the dispute and the relief requested. The parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from the JAMS panel of neutrals and in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties agree that they will participate in the mediation in good faith and that they will share equally in its costs.
All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator or any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation.
</p>
				<p>25. Arbitration
READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM DIVERSIFIED RISK SOLUTIONS, LLC..
If the matter is not resolved by informal negotiations or mediation, then the matter will proceed to arbitration as set forth below.
Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Additional Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in San Francisco, unless otherwise agreed upon by Diversified Risk Solutions, LLC.. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to either its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules or Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures depending upon the amount of the damages claimed, excluding attorneys' fees. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed as preventing Diversified Risk Solutions, LLC. from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights.
You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of this site, the Services, the Terms or Additional Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose.
If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator or arbitration panel to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of the Terms shall remain in full force and effect.
If any action at law or in equity is necessary to enforce these Terms, the prevailing party will be entitled to reasonable fees of attorneys, accountants and other professionals, and costs and expenses in addition to any other relief to which such prevailing party may be entitled.
</p>
				<p>26. No Class Actions.

ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE SERVICES WILL BE RESOLVED INDIVIDUALLY, WITHOUT RESORT TO ANY FORM OF CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS DIVERSIFIED RISK SOLUTIONS, LLC. AGREES OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS.
YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND DIVERSIFIED RISK SOLUTIONS, LLC. ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.
</p>
				<p>27. Entire Agreements and No Waiver.
